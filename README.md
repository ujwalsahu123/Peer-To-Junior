# Peer-To-Junior
A platform where the peers and juniors of a college can engage . 

Juniors can pick up the knowledge of seniors . Guidance is one of the most important things for a person . Through this platform the peers can not only give domain knowlege but can also show the path of the career (in different sector and subsectors of a industry) . Juniors can learn from seniors mistakes , and can give roadmap of what things do besides the academics . Guiding is the most important part of this platform but it can also be used for teaching to the juniors . the talented candidate will be choosed by us have a strong marks or experties or skill in a domain (the domain can be anything -!a subject , skill , expeties , competition , etc ) .so that there can be a community of college where skills and excellence is embraised . 

there was no one for guiding me ,and it was hard for me - but i gouded my self , and i see may people dont - and they just do academics and aquire no skills , etc . 

mrbeast -> it took me 11 years to get 100m subscribes , but if there was someone who told me what i know now , then it would have only took 3 years to do that . 

also 

there is no community of a collge .
if i seach for a college then its website shows up and all the clg info is shown by the clg only . 
there is no pltform where i can search for a clg and then see how is it , clubs in it and discriptions , top players/students (who are god level in something) , upcoming events ,  many great other things .
